clone2vec is a Python package for analysis of lineage tracing coupled with single-cell RNA-Seq.

The main key of the package are clonal embeddings — vector representations of the whole clones
in low dimensional space. These representations is a dropout-robust and cluster-free
way of representation of heterogeneity within clonal behaviour for cell type tree-free hypothesis
generation regarding cells' multipotency.

clone2vec builds representation of clones in exact same way with popular word embedding algorithm — word2vec —
via construction two-layers fully connected neural network (it uses Skip-Gram architecture) that
aims to predict neighbour cells clonal labellings by clonal label of cells. As a result, clones that exist in
similar context in gene expression space will have similar weights in this neural network, and these weights
will be used as embedding for further analysis.

## Installation

clone2vec might be installed via `pip` (takes 1-2 minutes on Google Colab):
```bash
pip install clone2vec
```
or the latest development version can be installed from GitHub using:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/kharchenkolab/clone2vec
```

## System requirements

`clone2vec` requires Python 3.8 or later with packages listed in [setup.cfg](setup.cfg) file. The package was successfully tested
on the following systems:

* macOS Sonoma 14.5 (Apple M1 Chip @ 3.20GHz × 8, 16GB RAM) — *MacBook Air M1*,
* Ubuntu 18.04.5 LTS, 64-bit (Intel Xeon @ 2.60GHz × 32, 256GB RAM) — *PowerEdge server*,
* Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS, 64-bit (Intel Xeon @ 2.20GHz × 2, 13GB RAM) — *Google Colab*.
